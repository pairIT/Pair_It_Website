Hi Everyone :)

I have placed the basics of bootstrap foundation, which will make the font end a breeze! 
feel free to visit http://getbootstrap.com/components/

I have also used bootstrap sass.
Why well because it is awesome and makes grouping css so much more organized. 
how to use sass.

1) create a new file with underscore and the name.scss
2) In the style.scss import the file you just made.
    Such as 
    // Import Bootstrap for Sass
        @import "bootstrap";
3) In your html/php only refrence the stylesheet stylesheet/style.css
    all your code will be compiled into there.
    
4) To compile your code, I think install compass... this can eaisly be done in your terminal if you have brew.
5) cd to where you saved your Pair it files which will be im ..mamp/htdocs for most of us and type in your terminal compass watch.
6) IF you however do not want to use sass just make a new css file in stylesheet as you would have done.
